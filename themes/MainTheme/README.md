# Main Theme


This is the main theme I use across my devices. Feel free to download it and use it if you like it!

I modified a couple settings to some themes and I decided to make my edits public.

Also, this theme requires my plugin that I created, which allows for Stable, PTB and Canary to have different themes from the same theme file. (https://github.com/Bido67/BetterDiscordAddons/plugins/ConditionalTheme)

Not neccessary to have the plugin in but allows for better support.
